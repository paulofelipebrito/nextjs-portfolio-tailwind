          In order to become a machine programmer through industrial automation, I entered the Mechanical Engineering course at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, where I had my first contact with actual programming. During the course, I got the opportunity to join a junior company where I did my first project with web programming, but at the moment I did not realized that this would be the direction of my professional life. 

          In 2021 I joined the IT job market as a Full Stack Web Developer with the following languages: Typescript, C# and front end framework libraries such as ReactJs and Angular.
